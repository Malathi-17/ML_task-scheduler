ML Task Scheduler

Project Overview:
This project is an AI-powered Task Scheduler that integrates Google Keep (tasks), Google Calendar (events), and Google Fit (sleep data) to generate a prioritized daily schedule using a PyTorch-based neural network model.

Features:
Extracts tasks, events, and sleep data dynamically from JSON files.
Uses a trained PyTorch model to predict task priority.
Generates an optimized schedule from 8 AM to 11 PM.
Runs in Google Colab with a Python-based backend.
Usage Instructions:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML_task_scheduler.git  
cd ML_task_scheduler  
Upload and run the notebook in Google Colab.
Modify input JSON files to customize scheduling.
